# 100 days of code challenge.

## Log

### Day1: 26th June 2017
**Thoughts:** I have always wanted to build my own website to showcase my art work. Now I finally got to it!

**Today's progress:**  Created a basic webpage (index.html) It took me more time to finalize what color scheme to choose than code =)

**Link to work:**  http://pkamath2.github.io/index.html


### Day2: 27th June 2017
**Thoughts:** The css tricks website is very helpful. display:flex is not so daunting anymore!

**Today's progress:**  Laid my paintings out in a flexible layout. Added titles and content.

### Day3: 28th June 2017
**Thoughts:** Good link for modal images - https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modal_images.asp 

**Today's progress:**  Opened images on click in a modal window. Need to include javascript and separate out the html markup.

### Day4: 1st July 2017
**Thoughts:** Have been meaning to try SVG & D3. Initial trials.

### Day5: 2nd July 2017
**Today's progress:**  Connected my domain to github pages. This is currently an iframed solution (I didnt want github pages showing in the browser address bar.
Definitely needs more work - not sure how child/linked pages will show from my domain.

### Day6: 3rd July 2017
**Today's progress:**  Tried SVG+D3 transitions today. I eventually want to build bubbles which move randomly. For now I just have one bubble whizzing past on the screen =)

### Day7: 4th July 2017
