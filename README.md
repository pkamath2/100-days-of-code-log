# 100 days of code challenge.

## Log

### Day1: 26th June 2017
**Thoughts:** I have always wanted to build my own website to showcase my art work. Now I finally got to it!

**Today's progress:**  Created a basic webpage (index.html) It took me more time to finalize what color scheme to choose than code =)

**Link to work:**  http://pkamath2.github.io/index.html


### Day2: 27th June 2017
**Thoughts:** The css tricks website is very helpful. display:flex is not so daunting anymore!

**Today's progress:**  Laid my paintings out in a flexible layout. Added titles and content.

### Day3: 28th June 2017
**Thoughts:** Good link for modal images - https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modal_images.asp 

**Today's progress:**  Opened images on click in a modal window. Need to include javascript and separate out the html markup.
